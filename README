UMIP - either User Mode IP stack or Microcontroller IP stack

Very limited ip stack for microcontrollers, embedded platforms, but can also be used via linux TAP interface.

Needs much more work, is currently designed for minimal resource usage. TCP support is very limited, and does not conform to standard, particularly wrt RST and socket close.

The priority up to now has been ensuring it works with very small microcontrollers (have a USB-ECE app for the STM32F4 using libopencm3 that needs to be committed), but most protocol testing was done using the usermode linux application.

To run as tap interface:

make
sudo ./umip.elf
sudo ifconfig <tap interface name> 10.5.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0

ping 10.5.1.1 (should respond)
curl 10.5.1.1 (should get a brief message)

Next phase involves adding routing and other features.

BADLY NEEDED:

DNS support
DHCP support
